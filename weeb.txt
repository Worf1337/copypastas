I can no longer go on without anime girls. Every day I wake up to look at my computer and phone, both equipped with anime wallpapers. The stares from the beautiful anime girls kills me deep down inside knowing I will never be able to interact with them at all. Today I woke up and turned my computer on, to be met with Zero Two, and tears formed in my eyes. Her beautiful green seductive eyes looking deep into me, I KNOW she wants me, and I want her so badly too. I want to kill myself so badly to be released from this hell of a 3D world. This reality is just too cruel. Why did God give humans the ability to create such beautiful sources of otherworldly envy? If anime just didn't exist, I probably would have been a functioning normie, but my inner desire is so deeply rooted in wanting to have sex with anime girls that I don't think I can recover. I don't even get horny for real women any more. Every time I masturbate to 3D porn I feel a painful regret in my stomach, but masturbating to hentai is one of the only things keeping me going. I am saving up for when some revolutionary Virtual Reality comes out, so I can become a full-time NEET and interact with anime girls for the rest of my life. help me
