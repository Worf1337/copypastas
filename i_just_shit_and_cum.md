# I just shit and cum.

# FAQ
- What does this mean?  
The amount of shit (and cum) on my computer and floor has increased by one.

- Why did you do this?  
There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be worthy of feces or ejaculation. These include, but are not limited to:
	* Being gay
	* Dank copypasta bro, where'd you find it
	* walter

- Am I going to shit and cum too?  
No - not yet. But you should refrain from shitposting and cumposting like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to shit and cum again, which may put your shitting and cumming privileges in jeopardy.

- I don't believe my comment deserved being shit and cum at. Can you un-cum it?  
Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I put shit back into my butt. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a hot load explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to retaliatory ejaculation within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of semen dies before it can fertilize the egg, and yours is likely no exception.

- How can I prevent this from happening in the future?  
Accept the goopy brown and white substance and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated in my mom's basement. I will continue to shit and cum until you improve your conduct. Remember: ejaculation is privilege, not a right.
